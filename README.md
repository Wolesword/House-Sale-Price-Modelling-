House Sale Price Modelling using PCA and Feature Selection
Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Please find inside this repository a code which analyses the housing cost based on relevant housing information.

Estimating the price of a house is an important step for new home buyers. This dataset indicates some using features in estimating the sale price of a house. In this analysis, I demonstrate and compare using of Principal component regression, model selection and ordinary linear regression in predicting the Sales price.

Furthermore, I have added few visualisations and descriptive steps during the cleaning of the dataset to offer additional insight on the data presented and answer some of the questions below:

ðŸ¤” Is my dataset complete or does it contain nulls?
ðŸ¤” What are my categorical features and could I encode them?
ðŸ¤” Are all my datatypes correct?
ðŸ‘¯ and many more...

It is still a work in progress and open to suggestions.

Cheers. W
